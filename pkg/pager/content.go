# Mercury Retrograde

Mercury retrograde is an apparent backwards motion of the planet Mercury as observed from Earth.
In reality it's an optical illusion that occurs several times a year.
This is due to the different orbital speeds of Earth and Mercury.

## Celestial Mechanics

From Earth's perspective, Mercury appears to reverse its course in the sky for a period of three weeks,
on average, three times a year. This phenomenon occurs because Mercury has a shorter orbital period
(88 days) compared to Earth's (365 days). As Mercury orbits the Sun closer than Earth,
it occasionally "laps" Earth in its orbit. During this time, Earth catches up to and eventually passes Mercury,
creating the illusion that Mercury is moving backward relative to the stars.

Imagine you're driving on a highway and pass a slower car in another lane.
The slower car appears to move backward momentarily, even though both vehicles are going forward.
This is essentially what happens when Mercury appears to be moving backward relative to Earth.

## Historical Context

Mercury retrograde was probably first documented by Babylonian astronomers around the 7th century B.C.

In ancient cultures the planets and the stars were viewed as manifestations of gods.
So any motion or phenomena related to the planets were seen as signs to be interpreted about
the fate of a "king" or "empire". The more individual-focused horoscopes came later on.

## Astrology & Symbolism

To understand the effects that Mercury retrograde is said to have on our lives,
(astrologically speaking) it's important to understand the symbolism of the planet itself.
Mercury is named after a winged messenger god in Roman mythology.
A god that symbolizes business, communication, charisma, travels, innovation, technology and more.
This corresponds with the same symbolism that Mercury has in astrology.

Take all these topics/traits into account along with the optical illusion of a retrograde motion.
While Mercury is in retrograde, these mentioned topics/traits will be in an "awkward/backward state" during this time period.
This is said to cause miscommunications, misunderstandings, technical issues among other mishaps relating to these areas of life.
