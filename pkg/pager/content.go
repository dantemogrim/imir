# Mercury Retrograde

Mercury retrograde is an optical illusion where the planet Mercury looks as if it's moving backward from our view on Earth.
The illusion occurs multiple times a year because it takes just 88 days for Mercury to circle the sun, compared with Earth's 365 days.

## Background

Retrograde motion has captured sky-gazing humans' attention for millennia.
Mercury isn't actually moving backward in its orbit around the Sun.
Retrograde motion is an optical illusion caused by all the planets moving at different speeds from one another.

It's kind of like driving on a highway with multiple lanes going the same direction.
If you're passing a car in another lane that's going more slowly,
they might appear to move backward compared to you, despite going in the same direction, and vice versa.
That's what happens when Mercury laps Earth. Because Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun
combined with its speed, it goes retrograde for an average of three weeks every quarter.

Mercury retrograde was probably first documented by Babylonian astronomers around the 7th century B.C.

In Babylonia, the planets and the stars were viewed as manifestations of gods.
So any motion or phenomena related to the planets were seen as signs to be interpreted about
the fate of a "king" or "empire". The more individual-focused horoscopes came later.

## Mercury's Symbolism & Modern Interpretations

To understand the effects that Mercury retrograde is said to have on our lives,
it's important to understand the symbolism of the planet itself.
Mercury is named after a winged messenger god in Roman mythology.
He symbolizes business, communication, charisma, travels, innovation, technology and more.
Same goes for Mercury's symbolism in astrology.

Take all these topics/traits into consideration along with the optical illusion of a retrograde motion.
While Mercury is in retrograde, these mentioned topics/traits will be in an awkward/backward state during this period.
This is said to cause miscommunications, misunderstandings, and other mishaps in these areas.
