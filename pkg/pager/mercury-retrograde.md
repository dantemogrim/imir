# Mercury Retrograde

Mercury retrograde is an optical illusion which means it looks as if the planet
is moving backwards from our view here on earth. 
Astrologers believe that, during this perceived backwards motion, 
technology and communication could get disrupted, putting a damper on anyone's summer mood.
